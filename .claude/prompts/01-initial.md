Can you analyze @chitchat1.png and tell what you see


Below the left and right panel you see a scrollbar. When the user navigates to a page with more contents, more
columns wll be added and the user can scroll to them column by column. The message menu goes to a new page where all
the people are listed who sent messages. If they don't fit in two columns, more columns are added to the right and
the user can scroll to them. When the user selects a persons name, all his/hers messages are shown. The content is
always wrapped into columns, so never a vertical scrollbar is shown. Can you implement this design in html and
javascript. Use the graphics from the screenshot.
